# Glome Basics (S³)

**Summary** We treat S³ as the *navigational* substrate for glyph lattices. We rely on stereographic projection for visualization and Hopf fibrations for fiber-wise traversal.

- Use `cluster: glome-s3` to collect glome-related entries.
- Keep math lightweight; focus on how projections affect *tone* and adjacency.
- Cross-link to `tesseract` and `spiral-engine` clusters for migration notes.
